 This was a simple task assigned to me to create a C++ console program that simulates rolling dice. The purpose of the project was to practice using random number generation, loops, and user interaction.

ðŸ”§ Features Implemented:
User can roll any number of dice (1 or more)

Each die gives a random value between 1 and 6 (just like a real die!)

The program shows all the results of the dice rolled

Keeps track of how many times the dice were rolled during the session

Asks the user if they want to roll again â€” only exits cleanly when the user types 'n' or 'N'

ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes:
Using rand() and srand() to generate random numbers

Handling user input safely and clearly

Using loops, counters, and simple logic to control the flow of the program

Practicing vector to store multiple dice roll results
